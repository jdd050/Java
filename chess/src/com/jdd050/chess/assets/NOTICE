All assets in this directory are drawn of my own volition, and are free to use. I did not create any idea or design for the design of chess pieces; these assets are derived from common designs found on google.

Software used to make assets: PAINT.NET v5.0.9 FREE edition (https://getpaint.net/download.html#download)
